# Gigster

A networking app for finding supporting musicians on the road by calendar availability and instrument. As a touring musician, I often found myself in a different city in need of other musicians whether for a performance or to borrow some equipment. This app allows a user to look up a musician by instrument and city and check their availability for a particular gig.
